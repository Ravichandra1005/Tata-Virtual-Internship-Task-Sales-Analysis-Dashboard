**Tata-Virtual-Internship-Task-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard**
As part of the Tata Virtual Internship under the course Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights, I worked on analyzing and visualizing sales data using Excel and Power BI. The project involved data cleaning, sorting, and filtering, followed by creating pivot tables and dashboards to answer specific business questions.

Data cleaning: Removed duplicates, corrected data types, filtered out invalid records.
Analysis: Built pivot tables to summarize and explore key metrics.
Visualization: Designed clear, interactive charts and dashboards to present insights effectively.


   Questions and what I did:
1️⃣ Monthly Revenue Trend for 2011
Created a pivot table and line chart to show monthly revenue trends across 2011, highlighting seasonality and peak months.

2️⃣ Top 10 Countries by Revenue and Quantity (Excluding UK)
Identified the top-performing countries by total revenue and quantity sold, excluding the UK to better understand international demand.

3️⃣ Top 10 Customers by Revenue
Ranked the highest-value customers based on revenue contribution using pivot tables.

4️⃣ Demand by Country (Excluding UK)
